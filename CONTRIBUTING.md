# Contributing to Cupertino

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cupertino!

## Swift Native

**Cupertino is a Swift-native project. This is a priority and a prerogative.**

Many MCP servers are written in Node.js or Python. Cupertino takes a different path — we're built for Apple developers, using Apple's language, with Apple's tooling.

We will only accept contributions in:
- ✅ Swift source code
- ✅ Swift Package Manager for dependencies
- ✅ Shell scripts for build/install automation

We will **not** accept:
- ❌ Node.js / JavaScript / TypeScript
- ❌ Python
- ❌ Other languages or runtimes

**No exceptions.** If you can't solve something in Swift, someone else can.

This keeps the project lean, consistent, and true to its mission.
