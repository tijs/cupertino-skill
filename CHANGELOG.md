## 0.2.7

### Fixed
- **Search Ranking** - Penalize release notes in search results (2.5x multiplier) to prevent them polluting unrelated queries (#57)
- **Swift Evolution Indexing** - Fix filename pattern to match `SE-0001.md` format (#61)
- **Database Re-indexing** - Delete database before re-index to prevent FTS5 duplicate rows doubling db size (#62)
- **Serve Output** - Simplified startup messages to show only DB paths; server now requires at least one database to start (#60)

---

## 0.2.6

### Fixed
- **MCP Server Tool Registration** - Fixed bug where only sample code tools were exposed (#55)
  - Created `CompositeToolProvider` that delegates to both `DocumentationToolProvider` and `SampleCodeToolProvider`
  - All 7 MCP tools now properly exposed: `search_docs`, `list_frameworks`, `read_document`, `search_samples`, `list_samples`, `read_sample`, `read_sample_file`
  - Follows composite pattern with proper separation of concerns

### Related Issues
- Fixes #55

---

## 0.2.5

### Added
- **CLI Sample Code Commands** - Full parity with MCP sample code tools (#51)
  - `cupertino list-samples` - List indexed sample projects
  - `cupertino search-samples <query>` - Search sample code projects and files
  - `cupertino read-sample <project-id>` - Read project README and metadata
  - `cupertino read-sample-file <project-id> <path>` - Read source file content
- **CLI Framework List Command**
  - `cupertino list-frameworks` - List available frameworks with document counts
- All new commands support `--format text|json|markdown` output

### Related Issues
- Closes #51

## 0.2.4

### Added
- **GitHub Sample Code Fetcher** - Fast alternative to Apple website scraping
  - `cupertino fetch --type samples` - Clone/pull from public GitHub repository
  - 606 projects, ~10GB with Git LFS
  - Much faster than `--type code` (~4 minutes vs hours)
- **Sample Code Directory Indexing** - Index extracted project directories (not just ZIPs)
  - `SampleIndexBuilder` now scans both ZIP files and extracted folders
  - Supports GitHub-cloned projects in `cupertino-sample-code/` subdirectory
  - 18,000+ source files indexed for full-text search

### Changed
- Sample code can now be fetched from two sources:
  - `--type samples` - GitHub (recommended, faster)
  - `--type code` - Apple website (requires authentication)

---

## 0.2.3

### Added
- **Apple Archive Documentation Crawler** - Crawl legacy Apple programming guides (Core Animation, Core Graphics, Core Text, etc.) (#41)
- `cupertino fetch --type archive` - Fetch archived Apple programming guides
- `--include-archive` flag for search command - Include legacy guides in results
- `include_archive` parameter for MCP `search_docs` tool
- Framework synonyms for better search (QuartzCore↔CoreAnimation, CoreGraphics↔Quartz2D)
- Source-based search ranking (modern docs rank higher, archive docs have slight penalty)
- TUI Archive view for browsing and selecting archive guides

### Changed
- Archive documentation excluded from search by default (use `--include-archive` or `--source apple-archive`)
- Updated MCP tool description to document archive features

### Related Issues
- Closes #41

## 0.2.2

### Added
- Intelligent kind inference for unknown document types using URL depth, title patterns, and word count signals
- Improved search ranking for core types when `kind=unknown`

### Fixed
- Fixed URL scheme error when resuming crawl session (#47)

### Related Issues
- Closes #47
- Related to #28 (Search Ranking Improvements)

---

## 0.2.1

### Fixed
- Fixed crawler filename collision causing parent documentation pages to be overwritten by operators/methods (#45)
- Crawler now generates unique filenames for URLs with special characters using hash suffixes
- Parent types (Text, Color, Date, String structs) will be restored on next crawl

### Related Issues
- Closes #45
- Related to #28 (Search Ranking Improvements)

---

## 0.2.0

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed cleanup bug that deleted source code instead of .git folders (#40)
- Simplified `compressDirectory()` to preserve Apple's flat ZIP structure
- Reduced cleanup patterns to only safe items: .git, .DS_Store, DerivedData, build, .build, xcuserdata, *.xcuserstate
- Verified all 606/607 sample ZIPs contain intact source code (1 corrupted in original download)
- Cleanup now achieves 44% space reduction (27GB → 15GB) while preserving all code

---

## 0.1.9

### Added
- `--language` filter for search (swift, objc) - CLI and MCP (#34)
- `source` parameter to MCP `search_docs` tool (#38)

### Changed
- Database schema v5 - added `language` column to docs_fts and docs_metadata
- **BREAKING**: Requires database rebuild (`rm ~/.cupertino/search.db && cupertino save`)

---

## 0.1.8

### Added
- `cupertino cleanup` - Clean up sample code archives by removing .git, .DS_Store, xcuserdata, etc. (#31)
- Dry run mode (`--dry-run`) to preview cleanup without modifying files
- Keep originals mode (`--keep-originals`) to preserve original ZIPs

### Changed
- Reorganized docs folder structure to be self-illustrating (folders show command syntax)
- Removed unused serve command options (`--docs-dir`, `--evolution-dir`, `--search-db`)

### Fixed
- Dry run now correctly detects nested junk files (e.g., `.git/hooks/*`)

---

## 0.1.7

### Added
- Unified logging system with categories and log levels (#26, #30)
- Search tests for swift-book URIs

### Fixed
- `read_document` returning empty content for swift-book URIs
- Consolidated logging across all modules

---

## 0.1.6

### Added
- `cupertino search` - CLI command for searching documentation without MCP server (#23)
- `cupertino read` - CLI command for reading full documents by URI
- `summaryTruncated` field in search results for AI agents
- Truncation indicator with word count in text output
- Comprehensive command documentation in `docs/commands/`

### Changed
- Increased summary limit from 500 to 1500 characters
