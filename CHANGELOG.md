## 0.2.0

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed cleanup bug that deleted source code instead of .git folders (#40)
- Simplified `compressDirectory()` to preserve Apple's flat ZIP structure
- Reduced cleanup patterns to only safe items: .git, .DS_Store, DerivedData, build, .build, xcuserdata, *.xcuserstate
- Verified all 606/607 sample ZIPs contain intact source code (1 corrupted in original download)
- Cleanup now achieves 44% space reduction (27GB → 15GB) while preserving all code

---

## 0.1.9

### Added
- `--language` filter for search (swift, objc) - CLI and MCP (#34)
- `source` parameter to MCP `search_docs` tool (#38)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Requires database rebuild (`rm ~/.cupertino/search.db && cupertino save`)

---

## 0.1.8

### Added
- `cupertino cleanup` - Clean up sample code archives by removing .git, .DS_Store, xcuserdata, etc. (#31)
- Dry run mode (`--dry-run`) to preview cleanup without modifying files

### Changed
- Reorganized docs folder structure to be self-illustrating (folders show command syntax)

### Fixed
- Dry run now correctly detects nested junk files (e.g., `.git/hooks/*`)

---
